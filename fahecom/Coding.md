# Coding problem

We have a company with many employees and the management decides to give them different kinds of bonuses, based on different rules. New bonuses can be introduced at any time.
Examples of bonus:
     1. 5% salary bonus on the birthday month for all employees younger than 30
     2. $500 bonus for all women who have children, on the birthday of their children
     3. 10% bonus for regular employee, 15% for management employee paid for company celebration day

Define a system that calculates the bonus for each employee in the company, at any given time.
