Q-1(Can be solved with trie and BFS): Numbers on a dial pad 
List of words and a number -> return words that can be made from that number

e.g [cat,dog,abc] [117] -> returns [cat]


Q-2 (Standard GRAPH and BFS) Given a list of connecting flights, origin and destination
Return True false based on whether you can travel from one place to another

    (TOR, MONTREAL)
    (NYC, TOR)
    (MONTREAL, NYC) 
]
orgin = AUS, Destination=NYC ---> Should return True

(50-50: sliding window problem) Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T.


S= abcdefabc T = abc --->abc
S= aadsbcdefaabc T = aabc ---> aabc
S= aadsbcdefaab T = aabc ---> aadsbc
